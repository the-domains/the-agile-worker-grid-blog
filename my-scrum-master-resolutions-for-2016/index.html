the end of 2015 and it's been another eventful year in my life to say the least! Â  One big bit of news was that I finally got my Grid beta site which I'm using to make this first ever post to a new blog I'm starting "The Agile Worker Grid Blog". Â </p><p>I just had to get a plug for the grid in there and capture what I feel my blog here will be all about and that's the life of an Agile Worker. Â  What is an "Agile Worker" might you ask? Â  Well right now I'm a Scrum Master for a company here in the Denver area but I didn't want this to be just a Scrum Master blog. Â I feel my day to day work is really in the Agile methodology and mindset and can apply to any area of work not just software development. Â  Yes my day job is software development but I feel having an Agile mindset and all the techniques used to do Agile software development can be applied to just about anywhere in the working world. Â So I plan on posting all sorts of stuff here not just about my life as a Scrum Master.</p><p>However in this first post I will be focusing on my life as a Scrum Master with my 10 Scrum Master Resolutions for 2016!Â </p><p>First off I want to say this post was inspired by two other posts I recently read and I'll point out which of my 10 resolutions come straight from their posts! First the great Mike Cohn and his <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/21-new-years-resolutions-for-scrum-masters">21 New Year's Resolutions for Scrum Masters</a>. I love reading Mike's blog and the advice he gives. I really feel he is a 'neutral' Agile Coach/Trainer in that he trains for an Agile mindset vs. Scrum or any other Agile Methodology. So thank you Mike for the resolution ideas and just being you!</p><p>Second inspiration comes from Len Lagestee and <a data-grid-id="0ae702e4-9f14-4e9b-b5e6-f8af52198f46" href="http://illustratedagile.com/2015/12/28/5th-annual-scrum-master-resolutions-2016-edition/">his post</a> on the Illustrated Agile site. Â  He has 3 simple resolutions here but again these helped inspire me to do my own list of resolutions.</p><p>Anyhow here are my 10 Scrum Master Resolutions for 2016. Â  Although now that I think of it I'm going to call them goals to strive for verse actual resolutions (another good post inspired this one). Â  Â Sorry I digress here are the goals already in no particular order.</p><p>1. Â Bring 4 new retrospective techniques to life</p><p>So I'm big on retrospectives and I think it's time for me to create some of my own 'games' for generating ideas and having fun with the retrospective with my teams. Â  So I figure trying some new thing I created once a quarter is a good goal. Â  Heck if they work I'll post about them here so everyone else can make them better!</p><p>2. Â Have a short 1 on 1 conversation with each member of my teams daily</p><p>I think it's important to connect with each team member as a Scrum Master and I don't think I've done enough of it lately so time to get back to it!</p><p>3. Â Host one discussion or lunch and learn on a topic of interest to the teams each month</p><p>Part of my role as a Scrum Master is that of coach and I think driving some discussion with the teams in a friendly lunch and learn environment will be helpful to all of us.</p><p>4. Â Set aside 30 minutes each day to 'think'</p><p>This one comes from Len's list regarding finding more time to think. Â  The best way to find time is to make time I say so I'm putting a goal in place to force myself to set aside 30 minute each day to really think about what is happening at work and/or at home.</p><p>5. Â Ask more questions and make less statements</p><p>This one I'm taking from <a data-grid-id="3700d86d-b9e6-49f5-9ab2-8a5ef00c082c" href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/21-new-years-resolutions-for-scrum-masters">Mike Cohn's post</a>. Â  I feel I tend to make too many statements vs asking questions so I'm goaling myself to change that in 2016.</p><p>6. Â No phone during meetings</p><p>Man I've developed a rotten habit of looking at or playing with my phone during meetings. Â  First off that's terrible and I need to stop. Â Second it gets me thinking about the meetings themselves if I'm drifting off to my phone but that's a discussion for another time. Â  Bad Agile Worker put that phone away!</p><p>7. Â Try sprint planning a completely different way</p><p>Straight from <a data-grid-id="5da884ce-6687-4553-ba1c-b771a5cb1f6c" href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/21-new-years-resolutions-for-scrum-masters">Mike Cohn's list</a> and I love it. Â Going to give it a go.</p><p>8. Â Listen more</p><p>Relates a bit to numbers 5 and 6 but sometimes I tend to make small talk or babble on about something when I should just be truly listening to the other person or group of people talk. Â  Also relates to just listening from my desk to hear how things are going with the team. Â Sometimes it is amazing what you learn about team dynamics or hear impediments going on that I need to get up and do something about.</p><p>9. Â Read on professional book a month</p><p>Got to keep learning at all times, continuous improvement is a foundation of Agile in my mind so I need to read up on new ideas concepts and refresh old ones as well. Â  This isn't strictly Agile books however can be anything such as re-reading <a data-grid-id="d582dafe-921e-4e92-936b-c5e377ea364b" href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451591143&sr=8-1&keywords=drive+book">Drive by Daniel Pink.</a></p><p>10. Â Post at least once a month to the Agile Worker Grid blog</p><p>I've been telling myself to start a blog and give back for YEARS. Â  Well now I'm starting down that path so putting a goal in place to keep this ball rolling. Â  I hope you get some value out of reading the blog. Â  Let the journey begin!</p><p>If you made it this far a big THANK YOU goes out to you. Â  I'm going to be figuring this Grid thing out and I'm sure there are going to be bumps in the road! Â  If interested check out the <a href="https://thegrid.io/">core Grid site</a> and see what it's all about but be warned it's still in beta at this time and they have close up the beta to new users.</p><p>UPDATE 1/5/16 - So seeing this on the web after publishing I'm a little disappointed in the formatting. Â  Asking the Grid folks for help to understand why some of the extra spacing is being thrown in here as it just doesn't look very clean. Â  Also not sure how to change the font size as it looks really small on a mobile screen and even on my PC/Mac. Â  Growing pains I suppose!</p><p>UPDATE 1/6/16 - So I figured out how to solve my formatting issues and got rid of all the extra white space that was making things terrible. Â  So other than the font being a little smaller than I'd like it actually looks much better now. Â  Turns out there is tweak to the layout settings on the Grid that solved the problem. Â Woo-hoo!</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="53"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="55"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="56"><span data-reactid="57"><!-- react-empty: 58 --><h2 data-reactid="59"><a data-reactid="60">The Agile Worker Grid Blog</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="61"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="63"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="64"></div></section></div></div>
