If not the concept is simple for the saying. When one opportunity, event, session, lesson, job, etc. finishes the door has closed on that thing. As the saying goes when that 'door' closes another one will open in it's place for you to explore. I've been thinking about that saying based on some events in my personal life and it got me thinking which is what I want to write more about today on how I think this saying applies to my idea of the Agile worker today.</p><p>So in Agile thinking I take the door as an experiment that either myself or the team I'm working with decides to do. We setup whatever experiment we are going to do and walk through that door expecting some other door we will find on the other side after the experiment is over the door/experiment closes. However I don't see it as just one door opening on the other side, I see that after the experiment we've learned lots of new stuff and that multiple new doors appear on the other side. These doors might be additional experiments, definition of a new process from the previous door/experiment, or any of host of other things. In the Agile worker world we are looking to continually improve and experiment and hence I like the new analogy of when one door close, numerous other doors open for you to explore!</p><p>Anyhow just a simple thought I had for the day.
