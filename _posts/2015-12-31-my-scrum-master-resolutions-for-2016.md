# My Scrum Master Resolutions for 2016

So here we are at the end of 2015 and it's been another eventful year in my life to say the least!   One big bit of news was that I finally got my Grid beta site which I'm using to make this first ever post to a new blog I'm starting "The Agile Worker Grid Blog".  

I just had to get a plug for the grid in there and capture what I feel my blog here will be all about and that's the life of an Agile Worker.   What is an "Agile Worker" might you ask?   Well right now I'm a Scrum Master for a company here in the Denver area but I didn't want this to be just a Scrum Master blog.  I feel my day to day work is really in the Agile methodology and mindset and can apply to any area of work not just software development.   Yes my day job is software development but I feel having an Agile mindset and all the techniques used to do Agile software development can be applied to just about anywhere in the working world.  So I plan on posting all sorts of stuff here not just about my life as a Scrum Master.

However in this first post I will be focusing on my life as a Scrum Master with my 10 Scrum Master Resolutions for 2016! 

First off I want to say this post was inspired by two other posts I recently read and I'll point out which of my 10 resolutions come straight from their posts! First the great Mike Cohn and his [21 New Year's Resolutions for Scrum Masters][0]. I love reading Mike's blog and the advice he gives. I really feel he is a 'neutral' Agile Coach/Trainer in that he trains for an Agile mindset vs. Scrum or any other Agile Methodology. So thank you Mike for the resolution ideas and just being you!

Second inspiration comes from Len Lagestee and [his post][1] on the Illustrated Agile site.   He has 3 simple resolutions here but again these helped inspire me to do my own list of resolutions.

Anyhow here are my 10 Scrum Master Resolutions for 2016\.   Although now that I think of it I'm going to call them goals to strive for verse actual resolutions (another good post inspired this one).    Sorry I digress here are the goals already in no particular order.

1\.  Bring 4 new retrospective techniques to life

So I'm big on retrospectives and I think it's time for me to create some of my own 'games' for generating ideas and having fun with the retrospective with my teams.   So I figure trying some new thing I created once a quarter is a good goal.   Heck if they work I'll post about them here so everyone else can make them better!

2\.  Have a short 1 on 1 conversation with each member of my teams daily

I think it's important to connect with each team member as a Scrum Master and I don't think I've done enough of it lately so time to get back to it!

3\.  Host one discussion or lunch and learn on a topic of interest to the teams each month

Part of my role as a Scrum Master is that of coach and I think driving some discussion with the teams in a friendly lunch and learn environment will be helpful to all of us.

4\.  Set aside 30 minutes each day to 'think'

This one comes from Len's list regarding finding more time to think.   The best way to find time is to make time I say so I'm putting a goal in place to force myself to set aside 30 minute each day to really think about what is happening at work and/or at home.

5\.  Ask more questions and make less statements

This one I'm taking from [Mike Cohn's post][0].   I feel I tend to make too many statements vs asking questions so I'm goaling myself to change that in 2016\.

6\.  No phone during meetings

Man I've developed a rotten habit of looking at or playing with my phone during meetings.   First off that's terrible and I need to stop.  Second it gets me thinking about the meetings themselves if I'm drifting off to my phone but that's a discussion for another time.   Bad Agile Worker put that phone away!

7\.  Try sprint planning a completely different way

Straight from [Mike Cohn's list][0] and I love it.  Going to give it a go.

8\.  Listen more

Relates a bit to numbers 5 and 6 but sometimes I tend to make small talk or babble on about something when I should just be truly listening to the other person or group of people talk.   Also relates to just listening from my desk to hear how things are going with the team.  Sometimes it is amazing what you learn about team dynamics or hear impediments going on that I need to get up and do something about.

9\.  Read on professional book a month

Got to keep learning at all times, continuous improvement is a foundation of Agile in my mind so I need to read up on new ideas concepts and refresh old ones as well.   This isn't strictly Agile books however can be anything such as re-reading [Drive by Daniel Pink.][2]

10\.  Post at least once a month to the Agile Worker Grid blog

I've been telling myself to start a blog and give back for YEARS.   Well now I'm starting down that path so putting a goal in place to keep this ball rolling.   I hope you get some value out of reading the blog.   Let the journey begin!

If you made it this far a big THANK YOU goes out to you.   I'm going to be figuring this Grid thing out and I'm sure there are going to be bumps in the road!   If interested check out the [core Grid site][3] and see what it's all about but be warned it's still in beta at this time and they have close up the beta to new users.

UPDATE 1/6/16 - So seeing this on the web after publishing I'm a little disappointed in the formatting.   Asking the Grid folks for help to understand why some of the extra spacing is being thrown in here as it just doesn't look very clean.   Also not sure how to change the font size as it looks really small on a mobile screen and even on my PC/Mac.   Growing pains I suppose!
