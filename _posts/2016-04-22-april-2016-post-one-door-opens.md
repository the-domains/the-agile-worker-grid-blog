description: "Ok so I've been a bit of a slacker when it comes to my resolution regarding posting to this site once a month. Wait I should say my resolution target, which means I just missed my target and that's ok. I'm going to get better as I'm learning to better juggle my time and get some time for this sort of thing. Alas I'm already digressing from what I wanted to talk about so let's get back to it now shall we?"

Ok so I've been a bit of a slacker when it comes to my resolution regarding posting to this site once a month. Wait I should say my resolution target, which means I just missed my target and that's ok. I'm going to get better as I'm learning to better juggle my time and get some time for this sort of thing. Alas I'm already digressing from what I wanted to talk about so let's get back to it now shall we?

So you've all hopefully hear the old say "When one door closes another one opens". If not the concept is simple for the saying. When one opportunity, event, session, lesson, job, etc. finishes the door has closed on that thing. As the saying goes when that 'door' closes another one will open in it's place for you to explore. I've been thinking about that saying based on some events in my personal life and it got me thinking which is what I want to write more about today on how I think this saying applies to my idea of the Agile worker today.

So in Agile thinking I take the door as an experiment that either myself or the team I'm working with decides to do. We setup whatever experiment we are going to do and walk through that door expecting some other door we will find on the other side after the experiment is over the door/experiment closes. However I don't see it as just one door opening on the other side, I see that after the experiment we've learned lots of new stuff and that multiple new doors appear on the other side. These doors might be additional experiments, definition of a new process from the previous door/experiment, or any of host of other things. In the Agile worker world we are looking to continually improve and experiment and hence I like the new analogy of when one door close, numerous other doors open for you to explore!

Anyhow just a simple thought I had for the day. Hopefully you got a small slice of value out of the thought and I look forward to my next post when I get to it soon.
